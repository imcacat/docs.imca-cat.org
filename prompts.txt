**Feeding the Werewolves**
While werewolves are hardy community members, keep in mind the following dietary concerns:

- They are allergic to cinnamon.
- More than two glasses of orange juice in 24 hours makes them howl in harmony with alarms and sirens.
- Celery makes them sad.

```ruby
require 'sinatra' # Library import

get '/hi' do # URL mapping
  "Hello World!" # Response block
end
```
