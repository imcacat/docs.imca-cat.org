= Recommended Workflow for Mercurial in a Team of 10

== Introduction

In a team of 10 working on multiple documents simultaneously, it's crucial to establish a reliable workflow to minimize merge conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration. This recommended workflow provides guidelines for managing changes across multiple documents while working on different features.

== Key Concepts

Before diving into the workflow, let's understand some key concepts:

- *Branching*: Each feature or document change should have its own branch to isolate changes and facilitate parallel development.
- *Pull Requests*: Changes are proposed and reviewed through pull requests to ensure quality and facilitate collaboration.
- *Continuous Integration (CI)*: Automated tests are run on each pull request to detect issues early and maintain code quality.
- *Code Reviews*: Pull requests are reviewed by team members to ensure adherence to coding standards and catch any potential issues.

== Workflow Steps

Follow these steps to implement the recommended workflow:

1. *Create Feature Branches*:

   For each feature or document change, create a dedicated feature branch. Use descriptive names to clearly indicate the purpose of each branch. For example:

   [source,shell]
   ----
   hg branch feature-xyz
   ----

2. *Work on Features*:

   Team members can work on their respective feature branches independently, making changes to the documents they are responsible for. It's essential to communicate and coordinate to avoid overlapping changes.

3. *Frequent Commits*:

   Encourage team members to make frequent commits as they work on their features. This helps track progress and provides a granular history of changes, making it easier to identify and resolve conflicts.

4. *Pull Requests*:

   Once a feature is complete or at a significant milestone, create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch. Include a detailed description of the changes, relevant screenshots, and any necessary documentation.

5. *Automated Testing*:

   Configure CI pipelines to run automated tests on each pull request. This ensures that changes do not introduce regressions or break existing functionality. Address any failing tests promptly.

6. *Code Reviews*:

   Assign reviewers to each pull request to conduct thorough code reviews. Reviewers should check for code quality, adherence to coding standards, and potential issues. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

7. *Resolve Conflicts*:

   If conflicts arise during the review process, collaborate with team members to resolve them promptly. Communication is key to understanding the changes and finding the best approach for merging conflicting changes.

8. *Merge to Main*:

   Once the pull request is approved and all issues are addressed, merge the changes into the main branch. Be sure to update any relevant documentation and notify team members of the merge.

9. *Cleanup*:

   After merging, delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean and organized. This prevents clutter and confusion, making it easier to manage future development.

10. *Monitor and Iterate*:

    Continuously monitor the workflow and solicit feedback from team members to identify areas for improvement. Iterate on the process to streamline collaboration and address any pain points.

== Conclusion

By following this recommended workflow, teams can effectively collaborate on Mercurial projects, minimizing conflicts and ensuring smooth integration of changes. Clear communication, diligent testing, and thorough code reviews are essential pillars of this workflow, fostering a culture of collaboration and quality assurance.
