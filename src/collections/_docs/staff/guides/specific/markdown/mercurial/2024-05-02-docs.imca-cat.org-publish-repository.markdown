# Recommended Workflow for Publishing with GitLab CI

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to publish your website or documentation using GitLab CI. This automated process ensures consistency and reliability in your publishing workflow.

## Key Concepts

Before we dive in, let's understand some key concepts:

- **GitLab CI/CD**: GitLab Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code.
- **Jekyll**: Jekyll is a static site generator used to build websites or documentation from text files.
- **SSH**: Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure communication between a client and a server.
- **Rsync**: Rsync is a file synchronization tool for efficiently transferring files between directories or servers.

## Workflow Steps

Follow these steps to publish your content using GitLab CI:

1. **Configure GitLab CI/CD**:

   Add the provided `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your GitLab project repository and ensure that CI/CD pipelines are enabled.

2. **Build Stage**:

   In the `build` stage of the CI pipeline, project dependencies are installed, and Jekyll builds your website or documentation. The resulting files are stored in the `public` directory.

3. **Test Stage**:

   The `test` stage deploys the built files to a test environment for further validation. This ensures that the content functions correctly before deploying to production.

4. **Deploy Stage**:

   The `deploy` stage deploys the built files to the production environment using SSH and rsync.

5. **SSH Configuration**:

   Configure SSH keys and ensure they are added to the GitLab CI/CD settings for secure authentication.

6. **Update Configuration Variables**:

   Modify variables in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to match your environment, such as `SERVER_NAME`, `CONNECTION_STR`, `PROJECT_NAME`, `DEPLOY_PATH`, and `PRIVATE_KEY`.

7. **Run the Pipeline**:

   Trigger the CI/CD pipeline by pushing changes to your GitLab repository. GitLab will automatically run the pipeline, including build, test, and deploy stages.

8. **Monitor Deployment**:

   Monitor the pipeline execution in the GitLab CI/CD interface to ensure each stage completes successfully.

9. **Access the Published Content**:

   Once the pipeline completes successfully, access your published website or documentation using the specified `SERVER_NAME` or deployment server URL.

## Conclusion

By following this guide and utilizing GitLab CI, you can automate the publishing process of your website or documentation. This ensures consistency, reliability, and efficient deployment across environments.
